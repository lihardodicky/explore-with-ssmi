# Explore-with-SSMI
Hi guys! We can amplify this repo for today's workshops, which may will help us to understand the basic of the python code itself. Enjoy learning, peace!

## What you'll learn
- Python data analysis with pandas
- Creating impactful visualizations (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)
- Dashboarding (maybe utilize streamlit?)
- Generating actionable insights from real data
- Basic machine learning for customer segmentation

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org-or-username>/customer-behavior-insight-workshop.git
# example: git clone https://github.com/lihardodicky/explore-with-ssmi.git
cd customer-behavior-insight-workshop
```

### 2. Install dependencies
Recommend using a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Launch Jupyter Lab
```bash
jupyter lab
```
